WEV (Web Event Viewer) is an ASP.NET MVC 3 based web application for viewing Windows event logs. It has a simple UI, powerful filtering (filter event text, dates, source from the list) and allows you to aggregate event log entries from other servers that have WEV on their web server.

This project contains two downloads:
- The MVC site. This displays the event logs as shown in the screenshots below.
- HTTP Listener windows service. Install this on machines that do not, or you do not want to have to install IIS on.
